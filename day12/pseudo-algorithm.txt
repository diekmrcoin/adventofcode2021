If the graph has m edges, n nodes, and p paths
from the source s to the target t,
path // is a stack (initially empty)
seen // is a set

def stuck(x)
   if x == t
     return False
   for each neighbor y of x
     if y not in seen
       insert y in seen
       if !stuck(y)
         return False
   return True

def search(x)
  if x == t
    print path
    return
  seen = set(path)
  if stuck(x)
    return
  for each neighbor y of x
    if y not in path:
      push y on the path
      search(y)
      pop y from the path
