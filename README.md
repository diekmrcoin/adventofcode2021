# Advent of Code 2021

### Objective

My personal objective doing this advent of code **is just to solve** every problem **in the same day** as it's released.

#### Don't expect to find beautiful solutions, clean of optimized in any way.

***

[Advent of Code 2021 website](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

You can see the code of every day and the variations in code between part 1 and part 2.

You can execute all the days with the following commands:

- `yarn install`
- `./benchmark.sh`

### Advent of Code 2021 benchmark

The benchmark is for curiosity (due to day 6 part 2), my goal here is not the optimized code.
